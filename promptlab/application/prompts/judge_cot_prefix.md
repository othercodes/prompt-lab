## Chain-of-Thought Instructions

Before providing your score, you MUST analyze the response step by step:

1. **Review the rubric criteria** - Consider each criterion in the rubric
2. **Analyze the response** - Evaluate how well the response meets each criterion
3. **Identify strengths and weaknesses** - Note specific examples from the response
4. **Determine the score** - Based on your analysis, decide the final score

Think through your evaluation carefully before scoring.
